\description{
This function implements a tree-based graded response model (GRM) using
model-based recursive partitioning to detect and account for differential
item functioning (DIF) in polytomous items. The GRMTree combines the
statistical framework of item response theory with recursive partitioning to
identify heterogeneous subgroups in the population where item parameters
(discrimination and thresholds) vary systematically across covariates.
}
\details{
The algorithm works by first estimating a global GRM for the entire sample,
then recursively testing for parameter instability with respect to available
covariates. When significant DIF is detected, the sample is partitioned into
homogeneous subgroups, each with their own set of item parameters. This
approach allows for the identification of complex interaction effects and
provides interpretable tree structures that visualize how item functioning
varies across different patient subgroups.

GRMTree is particularly useful in health outcomes research where
patient-reported outcome measures may function differently across diverse
demographic, clinical, or socioeconomic subgroups. The resulting tree
diagrams facilitate the development of personalized assessment strategies and
can inform targeted interventions by identifying specific patient
characteristics associated with differential item interpretation.

\section{Conventional Graded Response Model (GRM)}{
Let \eqn{Y_{im}} denote the response of the \eqn{i^{th}} (\eqn{i=1,\ldots,N})
individual to the \eqn{m^{th}} (\eqn{m = 1,2,\ldots,M}) item. The graded
response model is described as:

\deqn{P(Y_{im} \geq j | \tau_{mj}, \lambda_m, \theta_i) =
\frac{\exp(-(\tau_{mj} - \lambda_m \theta_i))}{1 + \exp(-(\tau_{mj} -
\lambda_m \theta_i))}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{P(Y_{im} \geq j | \tau_{mj}, \lambda_m, \theta_i)} is the probability that
individual \eqn{i}'s response is in category \eqn{j} or higher on item
\eqn{m},
\item \eqn{\tau_{mj}} is the threshold parameter between categories \eqn{j-1} and
\eqn{j} for item \eqn{m},
\item \eqn{\lambda_m} is the discrimination parameter for item \eqn{m},
\item \eqn{\theta_i \sim N(0,1)} is the latent trait score for individual \eqn{i}.
}

This parametrization is equivalent to the conventional IRT formulation where
item discrimination is \eqn{a_m = \lambda_m} and item difficulty is
\eqn{b_{mj} = \tau_{mj} / \lambda_m}.
}

\section{Graded Response Model Tree (GRMTree) Implementation}{
The GRMTree is a hybrid model that integrates the GRM with model-based
recursive partitioning to detect and account for differential item
functioning (DIF) across subgroups defined by covariates. The algorithm
proceeds through the following steps:

\strong{Step 1: Global Model Estimation}

Estimate the GRM item parameters \eqn{(\hat{\tau}_{mj}, \hat{\lambda}_m)}
jointly for all individuals in the study cohort at the root node via maximum
likelihood estimation:

\deqn{\hat{\beta}_{\text{global}} = \arg\max_{\beta} \sum_{i=1}^N \log
L(\beta; \mathbf{y}_i)}

where \eqn{\beta = (a_1, \ldots, a_J, b_{11}, \ldots, b_{J,m-1})} contains
all item parameters (discrimination and difficulty), providing a baseline
model assuming parameter invariance.

\strong{Step 2: Parameter Stability Testing}

For each available covariate \eqn{X_p} (\eqn{p = 1, \ldots, P}), assess the
stability of the item parameters by conducting score-based structural change
tests. This involves: 1. Calculating the score function contributions
\eqn{s(\hat{\beta}; y_i, x_i)} for each individual, 2. Ordering these scores
with respect to each covariate \eqn{X_p}, 3. Testing the null hypothesis
\eqn{H_0: \mathbb{E}[s(\hat{\beta}; y_i, x_i)] = 0} for all \eqn{i} against
the alternative that scores fluctuate systematically with \eqn{X_p},
indicating parameter instability (DIF).

\strong{Step 3: Recursive Partitioning}

If significant instability is detected (\eqn{p < \alpha_{\text{adj}}}):
\itemize{
\item \strong{Covariate Selection:} Identify the covariate \eqn{X_p^*} with the most
significant instability (smallest adjusted p-value),
\item \strong{Split Point Determination:} Find the optimal cut-point \eqn{c^*} that
maximizes the partitioned log-likelihood: \deqn{\ell_{\text{left}}(\beta) +
\ell_{\text{right}}(\beta) = \sum_{i: X_{pi} \leq c^*} \log L(\beta; y_i) +
\sum_{i: X_{pi} > c^*} \log L(\beta; y_i)} over all possible cut-points on
\eqn{X_p^*},
\item \strong{Sample Splitting:} Partition the sample into two child nodes based on the
rule \eqn{X_p^* \leq c^*}.
}

\strong{Step 4: Recursive Application & Stopping Criteria}

Repeat Steps 1-3 recursively within each resulting child node until one of
the following stopping criteria is met:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{No Significant Instability:} No covariate shows significant parameter
instability after multiple testing correction (\eqn{\alpha_{\text{adj}} =
\alpha/m}, where multiple adjustment methods can be applied, including
Bonferroni, Holm, Benjamini-Hochberg, etc.).
\item \strong{Minimum Node Size:} The subsample size falls below a prespecified
minimum (e.g., \eqn{n < 10 \times} the number of item parameters).
}
}

\section{Formal GRMTree Structure}{
The final GRMTree provides a piecewise GRM where each terminal node
represents a subgroup with homogeneous item parameters, explicitly modeling
the detected DIF structure within the data. The resulting GRMTree model can
be expressed as a mixture of subgroup-specific GRMs:

\deqn{P(Y_{ij} = k | \theta_i, \mathbf{x}_i) = \sum_{b=1}^B I(\mathbf{x}_i
\in \mathcal{X}_b) \cdot P_b(Y_{ij} = k | \theta_i)}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{B} is the number of terminal nodes,
\item \eqn{\mathcal{X}_b} is the covariate subspace defining terminal node \eqn{b},
\item \eqn{P_b} is the node-specific GRM with parameters \eqn{\beta_b},
\item \eqn{I(\cdot)} is the indicator function.
}

Each terminal node \eqn{b} contains a complete GRM with:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Node-specific item parameters:} \eqn{\beta_b = (a_{1b}, \ldots, a_{Jb}, b_{11b}, \ldots, b_{J,m-1,b})}
\item \strong{Local ability distribution:} \eqn{\theta_i | \mathbf{x}_i \in \mathcal{X}_b \sim N(0, 1)}
}

This approach allows \strong{differential item functioning (DIF)} to be detected
and modeled explicitly through the tree structure, where item parameters can
vary across subgroups defined by covariates, while maintaining the
conditional distribution of the latent trait within each subgroup.
