Description: Provides methods for recursive partitioning based on the 
  Graded Response Model (GRM), extending the MOB algorithm from the 
  partykit package. The package allows for fitting
  GRM trees that partition the population into homogeneous 
  subgroups based on item response patterns and covariates. 
  Includes specialized plotting functions for visualizing GRM trees
  with different terminal node displays (threshold regions, 
  parameter profiles, and factor score distributions).
